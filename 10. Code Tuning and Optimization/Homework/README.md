# Code Tuning and Optimization Homework

## Task 1. Solar System
*	You are given a C# application `SolarSystem` which displays an animated 3D model of the Solar system.
	*	Use a profiler to find the places in its source code which cause significant performance degradation (**bottlenecks**).
	*	Provide a **screen-shot** of the profiler’s result and indicate the place in the source code where the bottleneck resides (name of the file, line of code).
	*	Make a **quick fix** in the source code in order to significantly improve the performance.
	*	**Test the** code after the fix for correctness + performance.
 
## Task 2. Compare simple Maths
*	Write a program to `compare the performance` of:
	*	**add**, **subtract**, **increment**, **multiply**, **divide**
*	for the values:
	*	`int`, `long`, `float`, `double` and `decimal`

## Task 3. Compare advanced Maths
*	Write a program to `compare the performance` of:
	*	**square root**, **natural logarithm**, **sinus**
*	for the values:
	*	`float`, `double` and `decimal`

## Task 4.* Compare sort algorithms
*	Write a program to `compare the performance` of:
	*	**insertion sort**, **selection sort**, **quicksort**
*	for the values:
	*	`int`, `double` and `string`
*	Check also the following cases:
	*	**random values**, **sorted values**, **values sorted** in **reversed order**.
